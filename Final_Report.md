Introduction
============

In recent years, the human microbiome and its role and function in human health has become a popular topic of study and research. The microbes inside our gut have been linked to countless ailments and diseases, including many autoimmune disorders. (Clemente *et al.*, 2012) Although their purpose is complex and still not entirely understood, these gut microbes are known to play a role in training the immune system to recognize and attack potential pathogens both within the gut and throughout the rest of the body. (McDermott and Huffnagle, 2014; Lee and Mazmanian, 2010) Therefore, there is plentiful research being conducted on the role that these microbial communities can play immune system-related disorder both inside the digestive tract and in the body as a whole. A state of *dysbiosis*, or an abnormal gut microbiome, has already been correlated with numerous disorders, including diabetes, irritable bowel disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis. (Kostic *et al.*, 2014; Alkanani *et al.*, 2015; Scher *et al.*, 2013) In this analalysis, I chose to focus on the link between the gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis, another autoimmune disorder that has been linked to dysbiosis. (Cantarel *et al.*, 2015; Chen *et al.*, 2016)

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that is defined by the boody's T-cells attackin the myelin coating of nerve cells, causing nerve damage. (Miranda-Hernandez and Baxter, 2013) Some studies have linked its development to environmental factors, such as sunlight exposure and diet. (Riccio *et al.*, 2010) There have also beenn numerous possible genetic markers found throughout the human genome. (Oksenberg *et al.*, 2008) Although multiple sclerosis is likely the result of numerous interacting environmental and genetic factors, the gut microbiome can act as an interface for all of these factors, leading to the development of the disease. (Ochoa-Rep√°raz and Kasper, 2014; Wang and Kasper, 2014) In evaluating the role that the gut microbiome plays in the development and treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, it is important to note that correlation does not necesarily equal causation. However, a recent study by Berer *et al.* has demonstrated that gut microbes from multiple sclerosis patients can induce multiple sclerosis-like symptoms in transgenic mouse models. (Berer *et al.*, 2017) This indicates that the gut microbiome is not simply an indicator of multiple sclerosis, but plays a role it the development of the disorder as well.

In this analysis, I aim to discover the primary differences between gut microbiomes of multiple sclerosis patients and healthy patients, as well as the differences between different multiple sclerosis treatments.

Methods
=======

Study design
------------

The original study by Jangi *et al.* sampled the gut microbiome of 103 individuals, 60 multiple sclerosis patients and 43 healthy controls. (Jangi *et al.*, 2016) there were three variations of multiple sclerosis patients: those with untreated multiple sclerosis, those recieving treatment from beta-interferon, and those recieving treatment with glatiramer acetate. Both groups that had been recieving tratment had been doing so for at least 6 months. Both multiple sclerosis and control patients had no antibiotic use in the last 6 months, no probiotic use, no corticosteroids, np history of gastroenteritis, no irritable bowel syndrome, no bowel surgery, no bowel disease, no other autoimmune disease, were not pregnant, and had not traveled outside the country in the past month. All patients were also given a dietary survey before the collection of samples.

Sample origin and sequencing
----------------------------

To obtain microbiome data, Jangi *et al.* used stool samples that were collected by the patients and shipped to the laboratory overnight a 0 degrees Celcius. (Jangi *et al.*, 2016) Upon recieving the smples, they were stored at -80 degrees Celcius until DNA extaction, and were only subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. They obtained sequence data from the fecal microbes using both pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.

Computational
-------------

I processed and analyzed the sequence data using a combination of bash and R. First, I used bash to download and process the samples in order to determine their length and quality. For this analysis, I only used the pyrosequencing-derived sequences from the original study. Sequences of sufficient quality were then analyzed in R, using all of the relevant metadata and sequence information. R analyses were conducted through the usage of base R, as well as DADA2 and phyloseq. I made some additional analysis by exporting the fasta files derived from DADA2 into Geneious. (Kearse *et al.*, 2012) There, I used the FastTree plugin to constrict the phylogenetic tree that went into the phyloseq object. (Price *et al.*, 2009) Phyloseq was used to add various microbiome-specific functions to ggplot in order to better visualize the data (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013).

DADA2 was used for inter-sequence analysis and cleaning, such as forming OTUs and resolving minor sequence differences. The DADA2 pipeline begins with filtering paired fastq files by trimming them to a specific length and removing sequences that are too short, then further filtering based on number of expected errors, quality score, and number of ambiguous bases (Callahan *et al.*, 2016). Next, it can remove chimeras, which are sequences that are mare up of two parent sequences that result from sequencing errors. Lastly, it merges paired forward and reverse reads after all the sequences have been cleaned and de-noised, so that DADA2 can be extremely strict and require exact overlap.

**Figure 1.** Alpha diversity in patients by disease status

This figure shows Shannon diversity in healthy control patients and multiple sclerosis patients receiving each type of treatment. Diversity is relatively similar in all smaples regaurdless of multiple sclerosis status or treatment status. However, the multiple sclerosis groups consistently show a slight increase in diversity, especially in the Copaxone group.

**Table 1.** Phylum abindance in each

This table shows the abundance of each phylum in healthy patients and multiple sclerosis patients of each treatment type. Although the numbers are hard to compare between groups because the groups are of different sizes, there are consistencies in which bacterial phylums are the most and least common.

**Figure 2.** Normalized abundances of each phylum

This figure shows the normalized abundances of each phylum in each treatment group (A), and their respective standard deviations (B). Although there are several groups of bacteria that retain consistent relative abundance across all patient types, the Interferon-treated multiple sclerosis shows some major differences. Most notably, it contains considerably more Cyanobacteria and less Verrucomicrobia than the other patient groups.

**Figure 8.** Shannon diversty in Verrucomicrobia bacteria

This figure shows the Shannon diversity in all bacteria within the Verrucomicrobia phylum for patients of all disease statuses. There is almost no diversity in any of the samples, which is reflected in Table 5, that shows all of the bacteria in this phylum belongs to the same class, order, family, and genus.

**Figure 9.** Phylogenetic tree of Verrucomicrobia

This figure shows a phylogenetic tree of all sequences in the Verrucomicrobia phylum, with tips colored by patient disease status. All of the tips are very short, indicatin that there are no prominent clades within this phylum.

Discussion
==========

The differences in overall diversity between multiple sclerosis patients and the healthy controls were somewhat neglidgeable, althought all multiple sclerosis groups showed slightly higher diversity than the control patients. (Figure 1) The reason for this increased diversity is unclear based on my analysis, so further stuy would be needed to investigate this completely. One possible explanation could be that multiple sclerosis is cause by the presence of harmful bacteria, rather than the absence of beneficial ones. However, the correlation is not strong enough to draw any significant conclusions from. When looking at the overall abundance of each phylum in the patients, it is important to remember that the various sample sizes will influence the overall sum abundance. (Table 2) Keeping hat in mind, it is still apparent that the most common bacteria in multiple sclerosis patients are the same as those in healthy patients, such as the Firmicutes and Bacteriobetes phylums. GIven that these are generally considered the most common phylums in the human gut, this is not suprising. (Turnbaugh *et al.*, 2009) That said, there did appear to be significant differences in community composition between the control patients, as well as between patients recieving different treatment types. (Figure 2 A) Most notably, patients recieving Interferon treatment for their multiple sclerosis have a lower abundance of Verrucomicrobia and a higher abundance of Cyanobacteria. (Figure 2 A) This abundance of Cyanobacteria is particularly strange, because according to phyloseq, the Cyanobacteria in question all belong to the Chloroplast class. This raises the question of what chloroplasts were doing in the dark environment of the human intestine, and why Interferon apparently raised their abundance. This increased abundance is likely not an accident due to an outlier, because the standard deviation for Cyanobacteria abundance in Interferon patients is relatively similar to that of similarly abundant phylums. (Figure 2 B) Althougth he phylogenetic tree of the overall microbiome data shows numerous clades but no correlation between disease status and phylogeny, it is too large to draw any detained conclusions from. (Figure 3)

The first phylum I looked at in-depth was Firmicutes, because it had the highest abundance in control and all multiple sclerosis patients. (Table 1) Although there are many different species within this phylum present in the patients, there is no particular class, order, or family that is absent or present in one group of patients. (Table 3) This indicates that either the difference in Firmicutes microbiome content between multiple sclerosis and healthy patients is only apparent on the genus or species level, or there is no major difference for this phylum in multiple sclerosis patient's gut microbiomes. Based on my further analysis, I suspect that it is the latter, and the gut microbiome associated with multiple sclerosis is not determined by variiation within the Firmicutes class. In order to reach this conclusion, the next analysis I did was to find the Shannon diversity within the Firmicutes phylum. The analysis showed that the Shannon diversity within this phylum more or less mimicked the overall diversity for each patient type. (Figure 4) This makes sense, given that Firmicutes is the most common phylum and therefore likely accounts for most of the diversity in each patient type. The last analysis I used to determine this conclusion was the phylogenetic tree of only bacterium in the Firmicutes phylum. While there are several distinct clades in this phylogegetic tree, all of them appear to contain samples from patients in each disease type. (Figure 5) Given that Firmicutes is one of the most abundant phylums in the human gut, these findings seem to indicate that the Firmicutes bacteria present in multiple sclerosis patients' guts play the same basic role as those in a healthy person's gut. (Turnbaugh *et al.*, 2009) Therefore, it is likely that the bacteria that influence multiple sclerosis belong to another phylum.

The next phylum I looked at was Verrucomicrobia, because it was very abundant in every patient group except for the Interferon-treated multiple sclerosis patients. (Figure 2 A) Just like Cyanobacteria, there is sigificantly lower Shannon diversity in Verrucomicrobia in patients of every sample, which makse sense because it is also less common. (Figure 8) However, unlike Cyanobacteria, there does not appear to be a significant phylogenetic difference between Verrucomicrobia in multiple sclerosis and healthy patients. (Figure 9) The lack of diversity in this phylum both between and within multiple sclerosis patient sand healthy individuals indicates that it is likely not important to the development or treatment of multiple sclerosis. That said, the analysis I performed did not explain why its abundance appears to be so much lower in Interferon-treated multiple sclerosis patients than the other groups.

The last phylum I looked at in-depth was Cyanobacteria, because patients in the Interferon-treated multiple sclerosis group appeared to have a greater abundance of this phylum than the other groups. (Figure 2 A) I determined that this increase in abundance was not due to one outlying individual by looking at the standard deviations within this group, which was not considerably greater than the standard deviations of any other equally abundant phylums. (Figure 2 B) Interestingly, all of the Cyanobacteria appeared to be from the same class, Chloroplast. (Table 4) As one might expect from this information, the alpha diversity within this phylum was subsequently low among all individuals, including Interferon-treated multiple sclerosis patients. (Figure 6) That said, there is one outlier individual in the Interferon group with significantly higher alpha diversity. However, the area of analysis that shows the greatest difference between the Cyanobacteria in healthy and multiple sclerosis patients was the phylogenetic tree. This tree showed two main clades, one that pimarily contained Cyanobactaria from healthy patients and another that contained Cyanobacteria exclusively from multiple sclerosis patients. (Figure 7) This indicates that while there is little diversity in Cyanobacteria within patient groups, the Cyanobacteria found in multiple sclerosis patients appears to be genetically different than that in healthy patients. This indicates that there is a difference in the Cyanobacteria contents of gut microbiomes between multiple sclerosis and healthy patients, and possibly a connection between this phylum and the development or treatment of multiple sclerosis. One study links multiple sclerosis to a phage that is known to infect certain species of cyanobacteria. (Carter, 2012) Given this information, I think it would be interesting to perform a more in-deptht study on the Cyanobacteria in these patients' gut microbiomes, possibly looking for viral genetic markers or other, more Cyanobacteria-specific amplicons.
